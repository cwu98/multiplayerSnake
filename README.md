# multiplayerSnake
 A multiplayer snake game using socket.io.

The application uses socket.io to create a multiplayer snake game where 2 players can join the same game room and verse each other. It also allows multiple games to run simultaneously. 

To run the code:
Run the server.js (the code uses port: 3001). <br>
Then run the frontend (you can use a live-server).

The game is hosted on Heroku!
