# multiplayerSnake
 A multiplayer snake game using socket.io.

The application uses socket.io to create a multiplayer snake game where 2 players can join the same game room and verse each other. It also allows multiple games to run simultaneously. 

To run the code locally:
Run the server.js (the code by default uses port: 3001). <br>
Then run the frontend (you can use a live-server).


### Features to implement in the future:
- increasing difficulty (increasing velocity of snake as the game goes on)
- deploying backend to a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
- feature to restart game when game ends (currently, users have to create a new game after a game has ended)
